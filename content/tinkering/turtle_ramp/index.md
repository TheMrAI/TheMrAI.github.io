## Exposition

Having a Red-eared slider as a pet isn't as simple as one would believe. Sure, they are cute when they are just
2.5 cm in length, but they live long and grow a lot. Mine is about 17 cm in length and somewhere above 35 years old.
Don't know the exact date, my parents bought her around the time when my sister was born and that was before my time.
In any case ever since I could remember, I have been taking care of her. In this last 20 or so years I have learned a lot
about her, but for the purposes of this post there are only a few things of note. She is extremely stubborn, dumb
as a rock and does not consider me as a treat on any level never, ever at all.

As a female turtle she will get the urge to lay eggs a number of times each year. To lay the eggs, as a caring mother,
she would search for the perfect egg laying location. Dig a hole, lay her eggs, then spend about as much time she did
digging, hiding the evidence. We live in a flat, where for obvious reasons there isn't any dirt to go around. She
does not have a terrarium, because for her size that would have to be unreasonably huge. So as a best effort I let her
walk around each day on her own. This is when she would spend all the time sniffing and scratching all day, trying
to find the spot. Now this is pretty painful to watch as such an egg laying rampage will last until she succeeds, during
which time she will barely sleep and focus all her energies on laying those eggs.

First I have tried to mix her some soil for egg laying in a big basin and see what she would do with it. She would not care at
all. Followed a number of online recipes of using x amount of sand, y clay etc. and it never worked. As a last resort I went down
into the nearest park with my basin, and like some new age hobo started gathering dirt into my basin. Hydrated it a bit and she didn't
hate that. Great! Buuut, she still wouldn't lay her eggs in there. Not sure why. Whenever I put her in, she would just up and leave
after sniffing around a bit. It's like unless she finds the spot its no good. Bafflingly she would try to dig a whole into ceramic
tiles relentlessly, but not into the dirt basin.

Thankfully, since we have spent so much time together I can do practically anything with her, and she will not be disturbed in
her doings. This means that when she starts her digging protocol in the kitchen I just literally pick her up, carry her a few rooms
away and put her into the dirt basin. Then she would freeze for a moment, then as remembering she was digging, she would start digging
again. This "pick and place" action works even better if I prepare a nice little starting hole for her in the dirt.

## Problem

The dirt basin is somewhere 20 cm tall, and as it was said she isn't the brightest of creatures so if I don't cover a spot with something
cushy, she would eventually find that place and jump out of the basin right there, crashing into the concrete floor.
(Seriously I have no idea how these creatures survive in the wild. Not once have put her onto an elevated position of about half a meter,
she would look down, contemplate the abyss for a moment and jump.)
So I needed a ramp and the ramp I could fashion all those years ago was made from cardboard pieces and old bathroom mats. This would be
good enough that she could crawl in/out, but would never last long. She could always erode the structure quite easily forcing me to readjust it.

It would be nice to have a ramp, that lasts.
