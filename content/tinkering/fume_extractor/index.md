## The problem

Not so long ago I have started 3D printing and even before that I have been dabbling in electronics, which
entails soldering. For a long time I have been aware that soldering releases dangerous fumes, but that
somehow didn't bother me too much, because I simply don't solder that often.
However, after starting 3D printing and doing a few 6+ hour prints it became evident that something gets
released into the air. You have this hard to describe smell that feels unnatural. I hesitate to describe it
as "plasticky", because it doesn't even remind me of that, it is more like air pollution. Similar to what you
would experience breathing in the air in a crowded city center, right next to some high traffic road.

The easiest solution to do would be to simply buy a fume extractor, but these start from 500-600 USD or more
depending on the brand and type. A little too steep for the hobbyist.

## Idea

How about we make a cheap one from garbage? Yeah, that sounds more like it!

According to [Marco Reps](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarcoReps) there really shouldn't be too much to it.

Just a vacuum cleaner motor, some hoses and some filtration. The filtration material should be activated charcoal
(could be bought from your local pet store for fish tank filters), HEPA filter (from any electronics company
selling vacuum cleaner parts) and some hoses, some motor housing and all should be simple (My oh my was I wrong
about that).

## Construction

The hose, its connecting elements should be relatively simple, then we can work on the motor housing, the impeller
designs to make generate negative pressures for the suction action, and then we just need to put it all together.
