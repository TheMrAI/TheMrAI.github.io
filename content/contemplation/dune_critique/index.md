title: Dune series critique

summary: "A critique about the Dune books by Frank Herbert. Personal annoyances."
---

In this writing I aim to balance the books so to speak. The Dune novel series by Frank Herbert have
garnered worldwide acclaim, and precious little can be found about them in terms of critique. If you are
anything like me and get annoyed by lore inconsistencies then this writing is for you.

If you are in a hurry: The first book is a masterpiece. Then second and third are good, but not nearly as good as the first one.
Non the less the first three form a nice little story. If you wish, reading these three is still recommended.
Then leave, and find something else to read, not to spoil your memory of Dune.

This will also help those who like me asked themselves? Should I read Dune? Are the second three books any good?
I will try to point out my observations with spoilers along the way, so that you may judge yourself.
But if at any point, if you think you have read enough to decide to read the given novel. Please, for your sake, just go and read it.

## Dune

A 10/10 masterpiece. If you are interested in Sci-fi this is a masterclass book. The setting is intriguing, the characters
are interesting, the story is mesmerizing. Honestly can't really say enough good things about it.

## Dune Messiah

## Children of Dune

## God Emperor of Dune

3.5 thousand years have passed.

## Heretics of Dune

Okay, so at this point another 1.5 thousand or something years have passed. Every significant character is either an Atreides or has their genes.
Dar, Teg Miles, Sheena others are just mentioned to have their features. Okay, sure they have dominated the universe, the Bene Gesserict made
sure their genes passed on. This makes sense, even though it is getting a bit annoying. Surely there were other significant gene lines right? Haven't the
genes diluted at all? Apparently not, because Teg looks exactly like Leto the first.
And ... we have another Duncan. Can't we just let the man die? For like 5 thousand years the dude has been repeatedly brought back. Can't we just
write another character into the story? It has to be Duncan? Surely, we will have some epic conclusion why he persisted for so long without any decent
explanation (foreshadowing there will be none). Also why do the Bene Gesserict let him keep the name Duncan Idaho? We are told that the Thleilaux want
to kill him, that as a ghola shouldn't learn about his past self, because that would complicate things. So the Bene Gessericht, the guiding force of the
universe, the secret service of extremely disciplined women, some of whom have past self memories reaching back to the start of days, in their infinite wisdom,
have decided to name the ghola Duncan Idaho.

And now he is the chosen youth to be educated and become something special. But this time he is better! Through the Thleilaux gene modifications Duncan is now as fast
as everybody else. By the way, let us not forget that the Bene Gesserict have such a distaste for artificial gene manipulation, that not even artificial insemination
wasn't acceptable for Irulan in Dune Messiah. But hey, a few thousand years passed, everybody changed I suppose. Now it is okay.

So Duncan gets, trained by Teg Miles, a 300 year old (very old, even according to the book) Bashar of the Bene Gesserict. A super special mentat, with Attreides genes and Bene Gessericht training.
Sheena appears, does some irrelevant things on Arrakis. Which now we will call Rakis, to signify that has changed, but not the indomitable Duncan. Duncan never changes,
even when he does. Duncan is eternal. It is irrelevant to the story, but Sheena can "talk" to the worms. Why or how will never be explained. Nor does it have any
purpose to the story expect of getting our heroes from point A to B when needed.

For about 70% of the book nothing of import happens. The story tries to follow these political intrigue patterns set out in the previous books, but it goes nowhere.
Most of the book is not important at all. By around 80%, finally some interesting things start to happen. We have learned about the Honored Matres, that they are
dangerous, because they fuck so well that they can't be resisted?! That everybody follows their commands. What? I am sorry couldn't there have been a less
pedestrian idea? Okay, sex sells, everybody knows that, but to dominate everything with it? Seems like a stretch.
These Honored Matres are compared to the Bene Gessericht in their level of control, but over the folk of the scattering. The Bene Gessericht affectionately and often
refer to them as: "whores". Excuse me? For four books I have been shown that the Bene Gessericht don't play favourites, they don't care who lives or dies, they have
plans, they have contingencies, backups. They simply don't care, because they have accounted for all possibilities. Thus they never got personal. But now, the
Honored Matres are just whores... Ahh, it breaks my heart how low they have fallen.

Alright, so these "whores" are dangerous, because they would destroy the universe with their vile ways. The Thleilaux team up with the Bene Gessericht to stop this.
Uhh, I was so interested about the Thleilaux. We didn't know much of anything about them, but now we learn that they have impenetrable secrecy. Nobody knows their
secrets, nobody set foot on their planets, nobody know how their Axoltl tanks work. So exciting! Then we are told that they are religious fanatics. Cmon, really?
Another race that has existed for millennia in a universe where planets have been wiped multiple times in wars, where they are one of the top factions, with capabilities
of infiltrating almost every system. Are just some sort of religious fanatics, easily manipulated by the Bene Gessericht. Dynasties have been viped out, but some
fanatics, who could be easily misled didn't? My disbelief can't be suspended at this point. It is firmly bolted to the floor.

Anyways back to the good part. Sheena is on Rakis, Duncan needs to go to her from Giedi Prime (got renamed too, but can't remember), for some impregnation action
of course, but big twist, Honored Matres attack the planet and Duncan must be saved by the legend Teg. The best part of the book happens, Duncan gets saved, but not before
Teg becomes a super Saiyan. At some point Teg gets captured and is tortured by some alien device (MacGuffin), which changes him during his torture so much, that
even though he is extremely old, he just becomes much faster then anybody else. Faster then the Bene Gessericht, faster than the Honored Matres, nobody knows
how fast really. In short for him times slows down and he can destroy everything by his bare hands. Excellent development! In a universe where everyone from
the main factions has been meticoulously cultivated to be as fast, as strong, as smart as physically possible, Teg just doubles that in 2 days at the end
of his lifespan. Sure, what the heck, lets have some fun, if nothing makes any sense already. Wait, he also becomes prescient and can sense no ships? Just like
that someone simply sidesteps every law established in the books? Well, okay let us see at least the big battle we have been waiting for and, by the next chapter, the
battle has been resolved we are on Rakis. You kidding me? But wait! I got one better for you! Along the way Duncan has been captured and an Honored Matre want to
fuck him, so that they get control over him. No, no, no! Duncan of the golden penis, pulls the ultimate counterfuck move, and makes the Honored Matre his servant.

Wait ... what? So the big reveal of why Duncan was bred by Leto, the Bene Gesserict and modified by the Thleilaux was so that he can be the ultimate fucking machine?
That he can pound the Honored Matres so hard, they give up on their ways? Really? That is the story we are going with? What kind of nonsense is this?
Duncan, the pinnacle of honor in the first book, was kept around for 5 thousand years, to counterfuck the offensive? What am I even reading? Is this a science
fiction novel or some erotic fantasy? But when they ask him to copulate with the Odre that is too much right? "I am not gonna be a stud" Duncan is making his valiant
choices apparently.

After the big reveal they steal a worm from Rakis, by Sheena's help (the first time she contributed to the story), and bring it to the Bene Gessericht homeworld to
breed it there. Because apparently the Honored Matres were pissed enough that they would simply wipe out the most important resource in the universe.
Sheesh... This wasn't even a Dune book any more.

## Chapterhouse: Dune

Yeah nah yeah. The quality has been falling ever since the first book. The fifth book was extremely disappointing. Can't make myself read this as well.
In my mind the series stopped after the first 3 books. Leto made his big sacrifice and elevated humanity into a wiser level of being. The rest was fan fiction.
