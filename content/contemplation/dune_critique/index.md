summary: "A critique about the Dune books by Frank Herbert. Personal annoyances."
---

In this writing I aim to balance the books so to speak. The Dune novel series by Frank Herbert have
garnered worldwide acclaim, and precious little can be found about in terms of critique. If you are
anything like me and get annoyed by lore inconsistencies then this writing is for you.

If you are in a hurry: The first book is a masterpiece. Then second and third are good, but not nearly as good as the first one.
Non the less the first three form a nice little story. If you wish, reading these three is still recommended.
Then leave, and find something else to read, not to spoil your memory of Dune.

This will also help those those who like me asked themselves? Should I read Dune? Are the second three books good?
I will try to point out my observations with some spoilers along the way, so that you may judge yourself.
But if at any point, if you think you have read enough to decide to read the given novel. Please, for your sake, just go and read it.
Don't proceed with this critique any further, because I will spoil anything necessary to make my point.

## Dune

A 10/10 masterpiece. If you are interested in Sci-fi this is a masterclass book. The setting is intriguing, the characters
are interesting, the story is mesmerizing. Honestly can't really say enough good things about it.

## Dune Messiah



## Children of Dune

## God Emperor of Dune

## Heretics of Dune

## Chapterhouse: Dune

Yeah nah yeah. The fifth book was very disappointing. The quality has been falling ever since the first book.
Can't make myself read this as well.
