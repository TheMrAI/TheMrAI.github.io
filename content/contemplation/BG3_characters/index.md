# Baldur's Gate 3 Characters & Story

My primary reason for writing about this is to have some closure on Baldur's Gate 3. The game was so good that it consumed my all my free time,
invaded my dreams and thoughts. It is a sort of mourning, but one that I actually appreciate.
Maybe you feel the same way, or you are just curious, so I hope this writing will help you out too. If not with closure then perhaps with noticing something
you may have missed.

I will go through all the main characters and note down how their personalities have presented themselves to me and what I think about them.
Won't go into the story itself separately. I think the characters and their reactions to certain events made the story what it was, and they are so
intertwined, trying to separate them would be folly.

> There will be spoilers, all of them that felt necessary.

Since the **Lord of The Rings** books, hardly can I remember a time when I have found a single character interesting, let alone most of them.
In Baldur's Gate 3 almost all companion characters are very interesting and even some NPCs. Nearly all have some relatable story, even though
in our world there are no vampires, demons or undead. All of them have some development arc and all of them will change for the better or worse
depending on your choices. Like in real life if you are a good friend who walks with open eyes, you may nudge them onto the right path and
everyone will be better for it.

## Companion characters

Let's examine these characters and see who they are. Not surprisingly most of them are different from how they would first appear, and they may change in very
fascinating ways. As if the old saying "Don't judge a book by its cover.", really had something going for it.
Not all characters will be examined here. This is most likely because there just isn't enough to warrant a separate section, or I simply
didn't find them that interesting to begin with. For example Jaheira, Minsc and Halsin were all companions with some substance, but they were already fully developed.
They didn't have a real character arc, nothing that really gripped me. Along similar lines I am categorically uninterested in evil paths that would lead any companions down
into the abyss. For this reason, I can't comment on what happens if any of them do the worst things they can. Simply didn't see these, and it would pain me to do so.
Finally, I may be wrong on some of them or lack the complete picture. Only ever had the time to romance Karlach, Lae'zel, Minthara and Gale a bit. Some can be surprisingly
interesting as romance options rounding out their personalities even more. If I missed something about the others, this may be why.

### Withers

How Wither's describes himself:

> A scribe, a seneschal - a keeper of records.

A very constrained description given the powers he commands. Throughout the game he will resurrect all of your companions that have died by accident, but
he will categorically refuse to restore anyone who you have killed by choice or while being possessed. He judges the dead and only the dead. He cares
not for your actions or their consequences, only for the souls of the dead and what is best for them. Could they be sent back to the world of the living, or
will it be better for them to rest eternally? When someone dies their name goes onto his list, and when he resurrects someone their name gets crossed from it.
He will "cleave soul to body once more", for a mere pittance of coin.

As a veteran gamer we might not even recognize how odd Withers really is. In the D&D universe "resurrection", especially the form he does called "true resurrection"
is no small feat, so we might just ignore him as an instrument of good game design "let the players be able to conveniently resurrect their fallen party members", but
he is so much more. And to really know him one has to play through the game multiple times, pass some skill checks, get the appropriate conversations and observe.

In short, he is the original **God of Death**, the **Lord of the End of Everything**, called **Jergal**. He did his job very well for eons, but because he never desired
power and had so much of it he grew tired of his toils and when Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul stormed his domain to ascend to godhood he gave up most of his powers to them freely.
He then served Myrkul as the **Final Scribe**. Furthermore, he was displeased with what the Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul, or in short **The Dead Three** were doing to his office.
They were turning death into something to be feared, normalizing un-death and tormenting mortals with their games and schemes. Despite all this he diligently worked and
recorded the names of the dead. Then **Kelemvor** became the new **God of Death** in place of the **The Dead Three**. **Kelemvor** believed death was natural and that it
should be as peaceful as possible. His priests/priestesses would roam the lands banishing the undead and easing the passing of all who suffered. Then at the beginning
of the game Kelemvor sends the **Final Scribe** to aid you. This is not by his choice at all, as he will let you know immediately and just as fast he will start examining you.
One of the first things he asks upon awakening is:

> What is the worth of a single mortal's life?

Many options are given to us as possible answers, and he accepts them all, but seems to be happiest with "Each life is of infinite value and merits sacrificing everything for.".
Which is an answer alright, it may ring true too, but it feels a little naive, perhaps. There is another answer that sounds more grounded "That depends on a person's deeds.".
This seems fairer right? Otherwise, the life of a murderer would have the same value as that of a saint. However, death does not seem to care about such matters. He is eternal and
endless and to him all life has equal value. An individuals action's may stain their souls and when they face Death he will judge them by that and sort them accordingly. Until the
moment you die, this **God of Death** cares not for your actions. Until then everything is free game. In other words the message is "No matter your sins, you may redeem yourself.",
which echoes throughout the whole game. To really see why we need to see the arc all other companions, especially that of the **The Dark Urge**.

### Wyll - The Blade of Frontiers and Mizora

This is what Lae'zel has to say about him:

> The githyanki people have a word for men like the Blade of Frontiers: She'lak. Roughly translated: 'idealist do-gooder'. Or better yet, 'benevolent burden'. His confidence is an
asset. His pursuit of valour? Not so much.

Frankly she is right. Wyll proudly calls himself the **Blade of Frontiers**, the name he probably gave himself the same as he will do with **The Blade of Avernus** later on.
Uses every opportunity to proclaim his valour and spread his legend. The hero of the common folk. All true, but he is so much more. This is partly just an act.
Hard to see, because his character isn't outstanding in any other way. However, if we listen to what he says and observe what he does can we really see who he is.
A man of an utterly unshakable moral code and resolve. He would pick the burdens of the world on his shoulders, just so he can spare it from someone else. No matter the price he has
and must pay still.

His father is Ulder Ravengard, the Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate. A man respected for his qualities far and wide. Wyll ever hopes to follow in his footsteps. When Wyll was 17
his father went away on a diplomatic mission while some cultists attempted to conjure Tiamat, the dragon queen, and destroy Baldur's Gate. As devil's do, they use mortals for their
own purposes and whom better to corrupt then the well-meaning sole son of such a celebrated man. And thus Wyll was given a choice by Mizora the servant of the arch-devil Zariel.

> She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it. - Mizora

> She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city. - Wyll

He saves the city, eternally condemning his soul to Mizora and Zariel. To torment him ever more, when his father returns Mizora, a devil, awaits him by Wyll's side. Forbidden by
the pact, to talk about it, Wyll cannot explain what he did or why. His father only sees his son accompanied by a smirking devil. He casts him out. Yet Wyll never harbors
any resentment towards his father and says:

> He did the only thing he could. In his eyes, I invited a devil into our midst. I was a fool at best; a traitor at worst.

Even after years of being Mizora's lapdog he will claim it was his proudest moment, and he would do it again. Even though he completely understands the price he paid, and he will
vehemently oppose you taking Raphael's deal (another devil):

> He'll require of you only what you're least ready to part with. And then require more still. You might think you'd give up anything for a cure. But the devil won't take
just anything. He'll take everything.

Then when meeting Karlach whom he was tasked to kill by Mizora, after he learns that she isn't a monster he was told her to be, he immediately stops and violates the terms
of his pact. Knowing full well, that doing so will carry a punishment for him, likely a life ending one. Mizora comes and irreversibly turns Wyll into a devil.
Now he is a monster he wishes to protect others from. Yet, he doesn't waver. Not for a moment does he regret, becoming a devil to save an innocents' life.

Later on we get the option to break Wyll's pact with Mizora by letting his father die. You have to convince him that enough is enough and that he deserves a life too. Otherwise,
he just won't do it. He would rather face eternal servitude than to let his father die. Mind you Mizora was very clever, because she gave a choice which for an outside observer was
simple, but not for Wyll. Wyll's father has already been sent off to be executed, so the choice wasn't really between killing him and saving him, but letting things take their
course or performing a miracle.

If Wyll's father is saved (yes we can even if we break Wyll's pact), we get a final mission. To wake the ancient protector of Baldur's Gate, Ansur, a dragon of legend, to be
called upon the utmost of needs. Ansur would rise from his slumber and protect the city for a single time and depart. We go and find the rotting corpse of the dragon. Killed long
ago Ansur's spirit corrupted by hatred rises to destroy us. Upon slaying it, Wyll is disappointed that we couldn't gain such a powerful ally, but his father says:

> A terrible fate for Ansur, my son. Yet my hopes for the city's future have never been higher. You and your allies slayed the undead terror that was once the great Ansur. You
are stronger than even the great wyrm. You will be the one to part the storms and lead the people through. You, not Ansur, are the saviour we need.

Finally, when all is over, and Wyll has successfully broken his pact, became free and is offered to become the Duke of Baldur's Gate he refuses on his own. He does not seek any power,
only the strength to help those he cares for. Thus, when Karlach is about to combust, he is the first one offering to accompany her back to hell. A lonely mortal, a benevolent
burden indeed, but with enough faith and courage to face the impossible.

### Gale of Waterdeep

How Gale describes himself:

> I'm what one might call a wizard prodigy, who from an early age could not only control the Weave, but compose it, much like a musician or a poet. Such was my skill that it earned
me the attention of the mother of magic herself. The Lady of Mysteries. The goddess Mystra. She revealed herself to me and she became my teacher. In time, she became my muse, and
later, even my lover.

His story is ultimately about a rise and a greater fall. Which may not be that interesting on an initial look, but how Gale handles it is. Magic to him is everything:

> Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it. It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into
one and given expression through the senses.

Yet we meet him, with most of his powers lost and a magical orb inside him. An orb that needs to be fed with magic, otherwise it will erupt with such power that it would
level cities. We feed him with magical artifacts from which he can consume the Weave, but soon this proves too little. His time is running out and here we learn of Gale's folly:

> You see, no matter how powerful a wizard we mortals can become, we never scratch more than the surface of the Weave. Mystra keeps us in check. There are boundaries she doesn't let
us cross. Yet every time I was with her, I stood on the precipice, gazing into the wonders that lay beyond. I sought to cross her boundaries.

> As inconceivable as it seems to me now, I shared a bed with a goddess and yet I wasn't satisfied. So I sought to prove myself worthy to her instead. We come now to the crux of my
folly.

> Once upon a very long time ago, a mighty lord lived in a tower. A flying tower, to be precise. I'll save his history for another time, but the gist of it is that he sought to usurp
the goddess of magic so that he could become a god himself. He almost managed, but not quite, and his entire empire - Netheril - came crashing down around him as he turned to stone.
The magic unleashed that day was phenomenal, roiling like the prime chaos that outdates creation. Even the Weave itself could not withstand the onslaught. It fractured, then
shattered, and all magic was lost to the mortal realms until the day Mystra returned. She restored the Weave, reuniting all its scattered shards. Or so I thought, until in the course
of my studies I learned of a book. A Netherese tome in which a piece of the fractured Weave had been sealed beyond her reach. 'What if', I though, 'What if after all this time, I
could return this lost part of herself to the goddess? ... I obtained the fabled book and took it into my study. As for what happened next...'

He opens the book, but he finds a swirling mass of blackest Weave that pounces and burrows itself into his chest. Ever so hungry this Weave consumes his talents and even more. It
continuously must be fed, lest it destroys him and the surrounding city in an explosion similar to the fall of Netheril.

Netheril was an empire of legend. Cities flying in the sky, beauty and science at its peak. It was pure bliss until Karsus reached too far and everything came crushing down.
The fabric of reality shattered, then was slowly healed by Mystra. Gale just wanted to impress his goddess, but in doing so seemingly became deathly ill. Even worse, after this
event he can't even communicate with Mystra. As if he made a deadly mistake, one dire enough, that he is not worthy even for a discussion.

With his inevitable death approaching he feels lost until we meet Elminster Aumar, another wizard of legend, close to 1300 years old, bringing a dire message:

> You must know that the Absolute is more dangerous than you can possibly conceive. It threatens all who live - even those who are undying. It threatens the gods, the Weave, the
very fabric of the universe itself. That is why I have come to charge you, Gale, with its destruction. It is Mystra's belief that only you can.

Gale is expected to voluntarily sacrifice himself, using the orb inside him as a bomb to destroy the Absolute. And for this Elminster puts a spell on Gale, by Mystras bidding, which
stops the orb from acting up. From this point on Gale doesn't have to consume magical artifacts, he just has to die. We don't know more and Gale doesn't need to know more. He
accepts his fate. If by his death, Mystra would forgive him, he would sacrifice himself gladly.

When we first meet this so-called absolute, we learn that it is an elder-brain, a mind-flayer hivemind, dominated by three mortals, using a Netherese artifact, The Crown of Karsus.
The very crown he used to try and ascend to godhood. The Crown that destroyed a whole civilization and threatened reality itself. If we prevent Gale from blowing himself up here,
he will start contemplating taking the Crown for himself. In his misguided bitterness he believes that mortals should really achieve power comparable to the gods. So that they
wouldn't have to be their playthings. Can we blame him? He was cast aside by his goddess when he made a mortal mistake, left to fend for himself until his demise seemed of
convenient usefulness. He is contemplating it, but never truly seems to believe that using the Crown would really be for the betterment of all.

This is when Gale is finally granted an audience with Mystra, who asks Gale why didn't he destroy the Absolute with the Crown when he had the chance.

> I didn't want to die. And when I saw the Crown, I thought I might not have to, if I only understood its power.

> And you believe you have the right to such an understanding? The past cannot be undone with self-pity, nor can a future be forged. Only with the truth will you see the
way ahead. The fragment of magic you tried to return to me was not of my creation. It was the Karsite Weave. It is a corrupted, half-born magic wrought in the brief moment
Karsus ascended to godhood. It hungers for power just as he did, and it can never be sated. You unleashed something that would consume all magic in existence, and yet you thought
only of preserving yourself.

> That can't be. It wasn't - it couldn't have been. I only wished to prove myself worthy. I had no idea...

> You were already worthy. What you lacked was patience, and it cost you dearly.

> The only reason the 'orb' sleeps is because I have allowed it to feed on the true Weave - a temporary measure, but one that will not be enough to save us. With each day that
passes, the elder brain threatens to become a new kind of god, its worshippers a scourge of soulless illithids. If you will not use the orb to end this abomination, then
you must find a way to separate Crown and host. When you've done this, you must surrender the Crown of Karsus to me.

> I won't let you down again. When the Absolute is vanquished, I will surrender Karsus' powers to you. You have my word.

> Thank you. May the Weave's light guide your purpose, and its wisdom guide your hand. The future of magic rests on your shoulders, Gale of Waterdeep. I promise you - it is a burden
you are strong enough to bear.

And so he is, and so he does.

It is interesting to see in the end that Mystra never really abandoned him. In fact she put the fate of all magic on the line so that Gale could live a little longer and get a
chance at saving creation. In the end, all that Gale ever needed was some faith. Some faith in himself that he was enough, and some faith in her goddess.

### Minthara

### Karlach

> Karlach is life itself.

She came from absolute poverty, then after she started to build a life for herself, her patron Gortash simply sold her to Zariel, the arch-devil of
the first layer of hell, Avernus. There they ripped out her heart and replaced it with an infernal engine, so she may fight endlessly in the eternal blood-wars.
She spent 10 years in hell, alone, without anyone to call a friend. Her isolation was complete and privation maximal.
Then she got infected by the tadpole and has managed to escape. Now, in the material world, she lives on borrowed time, because her engine can only exist in hell. It does not belong
in the material plane, so she is literally burning up from the inside. The magical flames emanating from her make it impossible for anyone to even touch her.
Finally, she got out of hell and still she can't touch anybody. She is desperate to have a hug, but she just can't have it. Later in the story we may fix her engine enough that
she can at least have some physical contact but not enough to ultimately save her. Can you imagine the amount of suffering she must have gone through? Then to learn that there is
nothing that can be done? Her only option at survival seems to be to return to hell. Which for obvious reasons she doesn't want to do.

Despite all of this she never gives up and the only thing she wants more than anything is to live. She never allowed herself to be corrupted by her circumstances.
To be twisted by resentment and grief. In a sense she is incorruptible. She will never join your character in any evil act, in fact she will leave you immediately if you indulge in
any, if not outright trying to kill you.

Understandably she is fueled by hatred against Gortash and seeks vengeance. However, when we finally manage to kill Gortash, Karlach realizes that her revenge was for nothing.
She will die regardless, her life remains stolen from her and there is nothing left for her. She says:

> But there's nothing, is there? I killed the bastard who ruined my life, and my prize is that I get to crawl into a corner and die. Am I fucking missing something?
He's dead, and he's no fucking sorrier now than he was before. What was the point? I'm still dying. I'm dying. I'm going to die!

Then she completely breaks down:

> My heart. It was mine, and they took it. I'm going to be as dead as a Gortash any day now. Any moment. And what then? Off to the City of Judgement to waste into oblivion? Into the
dirt to get eaten by maggots? Is that it for me?! Is that fucking all?! And you - you'll just keep going, won't you. Watching the stars. Warming your hands on the campfire. Dancing,
eating, making fucking love all night - all of it, all of it. That's my reward for everything I suffered. That's why I survived ten years of torment. The fighting, the clawing, the
loneliness, the fucking loneliness... All of it, so I could rot. Because the person I trusted the most gave me away to the devil. It isn't fair. I don't want it like this. I don't
want to die. I want to live. I want to stay.

Then again as likely countless times before it, she eventually refuses to give up. If later asked if she is alright, she will say:

> Yeah, despite my best efforts. I kept trying to flop over and give up, but Karlach just won't let me.

Then you say that there still might be hope for her:

> Maybe. But I think... I think the gods are trying to show me my fate. And I think I'm ready to look at it. Speaking of which. There's something I wanted to ask you. Will you stay
with me? When it's time. For me to go. I think I can do anything if you're there. Even die.

After you obviously confirm this, because you aren't a monster she says:

> Now! Enough tragedy! I'm not gone yet. And our schedule is packed with important heroics, isn't it.

That is goddam strength right there! And wisdom too. To face the certainty of your oblivion yet despite your suffering, despite your absolute torment, choosing to go forward, do the
right thing until your final breadth. Every other character sees this too and even Lae'zel can only speak of her admiration towards Karlach. This is how I think we all should aspire
to become, at least in principle.

There are 3 endings for Karlach. She becomes a mind-flayer and lives, she dies or she goes back to Avernus. From these three only the last two are interesting. The death one, because
it really drills home who she was:

> I never gave up. I did my best. I did my best. It's the one thing I can't beat, isn't it? I wanted to live. In my city. With my friends. But life is for the living.
And I saw - gods (cry of pain)! Goodbye, sun. Goodbye, sea. Goodbye.

In my mind, however there is only one ending for her. When you convince her, with Wyll, the benevolent burden, to go back to Avernus together and face whatever may come.

> Better let these fuckers know I'm back. And this time, I'm not alone.

### Astarion

When we reach Cazador's dungeon there, we find many horrors. One of which is the skeletal head of Cazador's old master, Vellioth. The fragment of a mind left within the skull
shares something horrific:

> Vellioth's recalls Cazador, his lessons learned, killing him in the Rite of Perfect Slaugher. How they both laughed! Veillioth recalls Cayador boiling the flesh from his skull
and then, to mock him, clamping his Schooling Scroll in Vellioth's jaws.

Here Astarion learns the true extent of suffering they have brought upon this world when he meets Sebastian, one of the first of his victims.

Sebastian tells Astarion that he was the first and last person he ever kissed, reminiscing about his last moments before his abduction. In shock Astarion asks:

> You should be dead. Why didn't Cazador feed on you?

> He made me a spawn. Left me her to rot. But I can't rot - I can't die. How long has it been? - Sebactian

> One hundred and seventy years. You were one of my first too. - Astarion

And thus Astarion learns the full truth. Previously he was only a murderer bringing food to his master. Now he is an accomplice in the suffering of thousands.

After finally killing Cazador, Astarion is faced yet another brutal choice. Save seven thousand spawns, many of which he brought to his master, or kill them all.
Releasing them would unleash seven thousand souls many of which have been tormented for more than a century. The mind cannot comprehend their torment and the subsequent
madness that they lived through. So he, only has one choice. Kill them all.

After this, Ulma, the leader of the Gur's forgives him and offers a few words of encouragement:

> For us, destroying evil is a simple choice. We are born to do it - trained to do it. But to face your kin? To face everything you know and still make that choice.
There is nothing simple there.

> It is a tragedy so many had to die, but had they lived they would have caused a thousand more tragedies. You did not choose an easy path, but you chose the correct
one.

### Shadowheart

### Lae'zel

> Vlaakith requires everything of her children. I can't count how many bruises I've inflicted, can't measure how much blood I've drawn in the Undying Queen's name. I know only
blood-red and death-black. My mind is silver and my body steel. I am what I must be, say what I must be, to survive every beast I face and every wound I bear.

Yet, she is deathly afraid.

### The Dark Urge

> As it was, so it is again. A hero has risen from a legacy of death.

## Notable non companion characters

### The Moonmaiden & Dame Aylin

, and this will culminate in a scene
with Lorroakan. A wizzard, much like Gale of great talent, but unlike him, one that only serves himself. Lorroakan aims to bind Dayme Aylin back into servitude, so he could
siphon her life force and extend his life to eternity. So he could play god.

### Raphael & Hope

### The Emperor
