# Baldur's Gate 3 Characters & Story

My primary reason for writing about this is to have some closure on Baldur's Gate 3. The game was so good that it consumed my all my free time,
invaded my dreams and thoughts. It is a sort of mourning, but one that I actually appreciate.
Maybe you feel the same way, or you are just curious so I hope this writing will help you out too. If not with closure then perhaps with noticing something
you may have missed.

I will go through all the main characters and note down how their personalities have presented themselves to me and what I think about them.
Won't go into the story itself separately. I think the characters and their reactions to certain events made the story what it was, and they are so
intertwined, trying to separate them would be folly.

> There will be spoilers, all of them that felt necessary.

Since the **Lord of The Rings** books, hardly can I remember a time when I have found a single character interesting, let alone most of them.
In Baldur's Gate 3 almost all companion characters are very interesting and even some NPCs. Nearly all have some relatable story, even though
in our world there are no vampires, demons or undead. All of them have some development arc and all of them will change for the better or worse
depending on your choices. Like in real life if you are a good friend who walks with open eyes, you may nudge them onto the right path and
everyone will be better for it.

## Companion characters

Let's examine these characters and see who they are. Not surprisingly all of them are different from they would first appear, and they may change in very
fascinating ways. As if the old saying "Don't judge a book by its cover.", really had something going for it.

### Withers

How Wither's describes himself:

> A scribe, a seneschal - a keeper of records.

A very constrained description given the powers he commands. Throughout the game he will resurrect all of your companions that have died by accident, but
he will categorically refuse to restore anyone who you have killed by choice or while being possessed. He judges the dead and only the dead. He cares
not for your actions or their consequences, only for the souls of the dead and what is best for them. Could they be sent back to the world of the living, or
will it be better for them to rest eternally? When someone dies their name goes onto his list, and when he resurrects someone their name gets crossed from it.
He will "cleave soul to body once more", for a mere pittance of coin.

As a veteran gamer we might not even recognize how odd Withers really is. In the D&D universe "resurrection", especially the form he does called "true resurrection"
is no small feat, so we might just ignore him as an instrument of good game design "let the players be able to conveniently resurrect their fallen party members", but
he is so much more. And to really know him one has to play through the game multiple times, pass some skill checks, get the appropriate conversations and observe.

In short, he is the original **God of Death**, the **Lord of the End of Everything**, called **Jergal**. He did his job very well for eons, but because he never desired
power and had so much of it he grew tired of his toils and when Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul stormed his domain to ascend to godhood he gave up most of his powers to them freely.
He then served Myrkul as the **Final Scribe**. Furthermore, he was displeased with what the Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul, or in short **The Dead Three** were doing to his office.
They were turning death into something to be feared, normalizing un-death and tormenting mortals with their games and schemes. Despite all this he diligently worked and
recorded the names of the dead. Then **Kelemvor** became the new **God of Death** in place of the **The Dead Three**. **Kelemvor** believed death was natural and that it
should be as peaceful as possible. His priests/priestesses would roam the lands banishing the undead and easing the passing of all who suffered. Then at the beginning
of the game Kelemvor sends the **Final Scribe** to aid you. This is not by his choice at all, as he will let you know immediately and just as fast he will start examining you.
One of the first things he asks upon awakening is:

> What is the worth of a single mortal's life?

Many options are given to us as possible answers, and he accepts them all, but seems to be happiest with "Each life is of infinite value and merits sacrificing everything for.".
Which is an answer alright, it may ring true too, but it feels a little naive, perhaps. There is another answer that sounds more grounded "That depends on a person's deeds.".
This seems fairer right? Otherwise, the soul of a murderer would have the same value as that of a saint. However, death does not care about such matters. He is eternal and
endless and notice he is asking about the value of a soul of a person not of the person itself. This seems to be suggesting that before the judgmental gaze of death the soul
itself is incorruptible or divine. If so, one's heinous actions could be fully redeemed with proper sacrifice as it was never their souls that really have been stained.
Now what gets stained then is something that seems to be unclear, but this seems to match with the underlying motive of the game's story.
"No matter your sins, you may redeem yourself." To really see why we need to see the arc all other companions, especially that of the **The Dark Urge**.
