# Baldur's Gate 3 Characters & Story

My primary reason for writing about this is to have some closure on Baldur's Gate 3. The game was so good that it consumed my all my free time,
invaded my dreams and thoughts. It is a sort of mourning, but one that I actually appreciate.
Maybe you feel the same way, or you are just curious, so I hope this writing will help you out too. If not with closure then perhaps with noticing something
you may have missed.

I will go through all the main characters and note down how their personalities have presented themselves to me and what I think about them.
Won't go into the story itself separately. I think the characters and their reactions to certain events made the story what it was, and they are so
intertwined, trying to separate them would be folly.

> There will be spoilers, all of them that felt necessary.

Since the **Lord of The Rings** books, hardly can I remember a time when I have found a single character interesting, let alone most of them.
In Baldur's Gate 3 almost all companion characters are very interesting and even some NPCs. Nearly all have some relatable story, even though
in our world there are no vampires, demons or undead. All of them have some development arc and all of them will change for the better or worse
depending on your choices. Like in real life if you are a good friend who walks with open eyes, you may nudge them onto the right path and
everyone will be better for it.

## Companion characters

Let's examine these characters and see who they are. Not surprisingly most of them are different from how they would first appear, and they may change in very
fascinating ways. As if the old saying "Don't judge a book by its cover.", really had something going for it.
Not all characters will be examined here. This is most likely because there just isn't enough to warrant a separate section, or I simply
didn't find them that interesting to begin with. For example Jaheira, Minsc and Halsin were all companions with some substance, but they were already fully developed.
They didn't have a real character arc, nothing that really gripped me. Along similar lines I am categorically uninterested in evil paths that would lead any companions down
into the abyss. For this reason, I can't comment on what happens if any of them do the worst things they can. Simply didn't see these, and it would pain me to do so.
Finally, I may be wrong on some of them or lack the complete picture. Only ever had the time to romance Karlach, Lae'zel, Minthara and Gale a bit. Some can be surprisingly
interesting as romance options rounding out their personalities even more. If I missed something about the others, this may be why.

### Withers

How Wither's describes himself:

> A scribe, a seneschal - a keeper of records.

A very constrained description given the powers he commands. Throughout the game he will resurrect all of your companions that have died by accident, but
he will categorically refuse to restore anyone who you have killed by choice or while being possessed. He judges the dead and only the dead. He cares
not for your actions or their consequences, only for the souls of the dead and what is best for them. Could they be sent back to the world of the living, or
will it be better for them to rest eternally? When someone dies their name goes onto his list, and when he resurrects someone their name gets crossed from it.
He will "cleave soul to body once more", for a mere pittance of coin.

As a veteran gamer we might not even recognize how odd Withers really is. In the D&D universe "resurrection", especially the form he does called "true resurrection"
is no small feat, so we might just ignore him as an instrument of good game design "let the players be able to conveniently resurrect their fallen party members", but
he is so much more. And to really know him one has to play through the game multiple times, pass some skill checks, get the appropriate conversations and observe.

In short, he is the original **God of Death**, the **Lord of the End of Everything**, called **Jergal**. He did his job very well for eons, but because he never desired
power and had so much of it he grew tired of his toils and when Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul stormed his domain to ascend to godhood he gave up most of his powers to them freely.
He then served Myrkul as the **Final Scribe**. Furthermore, he was displeased with what the Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul, or in short **The Dead Three** were doing to his office.
They were turning death into something to be feared, normalizing un-death and tormenting mortals with their games and schemes. Despite all this he diligently worked and
recorded the names of the dead. Then **Kelemvor** became the new **God of Death** in place of the **The Dead Three**. **Kelemvor** believed death was natural and that it
should be as peaceful as possible. His priests/priestesses would roam the lands banishing the undead and easing the passing of all who suffered. Then at the beginning
of the game Kelemvor sends the **Final Scribe** to aid you. This is not by his choice at all, as he will let you know immediately and just as fast he will start examining you.
One of the first things he asks upon awakening is:

> What is the worth of a single mortal's life?

Many options are given to us as possible answers, and he accepts them all, but seems to be happiest with "Each life is of infinite value and merits sacrificing everything for.".
Which is an answer alright, it may ring true too, but it feels a little naive, perhaps. There is another answer that sounds more grounded "That depends on a person's deeds.".
This seems fairer right? Otherwise, the life of a murderer would have the same value as that of a saint. However, death does not seem to care about such matters. He is eternal and
endless and to him all life has equal value. An individuals action's may stain their souls and when they face Death he will judge them by that and sort them accordingly. Until the
moment you die, this **God of Death** cares not for your actions. Until then everything is free game. In other words the message is "No matter your sins, you may redeem yourself.",
which echoes throughout the whole game. To really see why we need to see the arc all other companions, especially that of the **The Dark Urge**.

### Wyll - The Blade of Frontiers and Mizora

This is what Lae'zel has to say about him:

> The githyanki people have a word for men like the Blade of Frontiers: She'lak. Roughly translated: 'idealist do-gooder'. Or better yet, 'benevolent burden'. His confidence is an
asset. His pursuit of valour? Not so much.

Frankly she is right. Wyll proudly calls himself the **Blade of Frontiers**, the name he probably gave himself the same as he will do with **The Blade of Avernus** later on.
Uses every opportunity to proclaim his valour and spread his legend. The hero of the common folk. All true, but he is so much more. This is partly just an act.
Hard to see, because his character isn't outstanding in any other way. However, if we listen to what he says and observe what he does can we really see who he is.
A man of an utterly unshakable moral code and resolve. He would pick the burdens of the world on his shoulders, just so he can spare it from someone else. No matter the price he has
and must pay still.

His father is Ulder Ravengard, the Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate. A man respected for his qualities far and wide. Wyll ever hopes to follow in his footsteps. When Wyll was 17
his father went away on a diplomatic mission while some cultists attempted to conjure Tiamat, the dragon queen, and destroy Baldur's Gate. As devil's do, they use mortals for their
own purposes and whom better to corrupt then the well-meaning sole son of such a celebrated man. And thus Wyll was given a choice by Mizora the servant of the arch-devil Zariel.

> She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it. - Mizora

> She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city. - Wyll

He saves the city, eternally condemning his soul to Mizora and Zariel. To torment him ever more, when his father returns Mizora, a devil, awaits him by Wyll's side. Forbidden by
the pact, to talk about it, Wyll cannot explain what he did or why. His father only sees his son accompanied by a smirking devil. He casts him out. Yet Wyll never harbors
any resentment towards his father and says:

> He did the only thing he could. In his eyes, I invited a devil into our midst. I was a fool at best; a traitor at worst.

Even after years of being Mizora's lapdog he will claim it was his proudest moment, and he would do it again. Even though he completely understands the price he paid, and he will
vehemently oppose you taking Raphael's deal (another devil):

> He'll require of you only what you're least ready to part with. And then require more still. You might think you'd give up anything for a cure. But the devil won't take
just anything. He'll take everything.

Then when meeting Karlach whom he was tasked to kill by Mizora, after he learns that she isn't a monster he was told her to be, he immediately stops and violates the terms
of his pact. Knowing full well, that doing so will carry a punishment for him, likely a life ending one. Mizora comes and irreversibly turns Wyll into a devil.
Now he is a monster he wishes to protect others from. Yet, he doesn't waver. Not for a moment does he regret, becoming a devil to save an innocents' life.

Later on we get the option to break Wyll's pact with Mizora by letting his father die. You have to convince him that enough is enough and that he deserves a life too. Otherwise,
he just won't do it. He would rather face eternal servitude than to let his father die. Mind you Mizora was very clever, because she gave a choice which for an outside observer was
simple, but not for Wyll. Wyll's father has already been sent off to be executed, so the choice wasn't really between killing him and saving him, but letting things take their
course or performing a miracle.

If Wyll's father is saved (yes we can even if we break Wyll's pact), we get a final mission. To wake the ancient protector of Baldur's Gate, Ansur, a dragon of legend, to be
called upon the utmost of needs. Ansur would rise from his slumber and protect the city for a single time and depart. We go and find the rotting corpse of the dragon. Killed long
ago Ansur's spirit corrupted by hatred rises to destroy us. Upon slaying it, Wyll is disappointed that we couldn't gain such a powerful ally, but his father says:

> A terrible fate for Ansur, my son. Yet my hopes for the city's future have never been higher. You and your allies slayed the undead terror that was once the great Ansur. You
are stronger than even the great wyrm. You will be the one to part the storms and lead the people through. You, not Ansur, are the saviour we need.

Finally, when all is over, and Wyll has successfully broken his pact, became free and is offered to become the Duke of Baldur's Gate he refuses on his own. He does not seek any power,
only the strength to help those he cares for. Thus, when Karlach is about to combust, he is the first one offering to accompany her back to hell. A lonely mortal, a benevolent
burden indeed, but with enough faith and courage to face the impossible.

### Gale of Waterdeep

How Gale describes himself:

> I'm what one might call a wizard prodigy, who from an early age could not only control the Weave, but compose it, much like a musician or a poet. Such was my skill that it earned
me the attention of the mother of magic herself. The Lady of Mysteries. The goddess Mystra. She revealed herself to me and she became my teacher. In time, she became my muse, and
later, even my lover.

His story is ultimately about a rise and a greater fall. Which may not be that interesting on an initial look, but how Gale handles it is. Magic to him is everything:

> Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it. It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into
one and given expression through the senses.

Yet we meet him, with most of his powers lost and a magical orb inside him. An orb that needs to be fed with magic, otherwise it will erupt with such power that it would
level cities. We feed him with magical artifacts from which he can consume the Weave, but soon this proves too little. His time is running out and here we learn of Gale's folly:

> You see, no matter how powerful a wizard we mortals can become, we never scratch more than the surface of the Weave. Mystra keeps us in check. There are boundaries she doesn't let
us cross. Yet every time I was with her, I stood on the precipice, gazing into the wonders that lay beyond. I sought to cross her boundaries.

> As inconceivable as it seems to me now, I shared a bed with a goddess and yet I wasn't satisfied. So I sought to prove myself worthy to her instead. We come now to the crux of my
folly.

> Once upon a very long time ago, a mighty lord lived in a tower. A flying tower, to be precise. I'll save his history for another time, but the gist of it is that he sought to usurp
the goddess of magic so that he could become a god himself. He almost managed, but not quite, and his entire empire - Netheril - came crashing down around him as he turned to stone.
The magic unleashed that day was phenomenal, roiling like the prime chaos that outdates creation. Even the Weave itself could not withstand the onslaught. It fractured, then
shattered, and all magic was lost to the mortal realms until the day Mystra returned. She restored the Weave, reuniting all its scattered shards. Or so I thought, until in the course
of my studies I learned of a book. A Netherese tome in which a piece of the fractured Weave had been sealed beyond her reach. 'What if', I though, 'What if after all this time, I
could return this lost part of herself to the goddess? ... I obtained the fabled book and took it into my study. As for what happened next...'

He opens the book, but he finds a swirling mass of blackest Weave that pounces and burrows itself into his chest. Ever so hungry this Weave consumes his talents and even more. It
continuously must be fed, lest it destroys him and the surrounding city in an explosion similar to the fall of Netheril.

Netheril was an empire of legend. Cities flying in the sky, beauty and science at its peak. It was pure bliss until Karsus reached too far and everything came crushing down.
The fabric of reality shattered, then was slowly healed by Mystra. Gale just wanted to impress his goddess, but in doing so seemingly became deathly ill. Even worse, after this
event he can't even communicate with Mystra. As if he made a deadly mistake, one dire enough, that he is not worthy even for a discussion.

With his inevitable death approaching he feels lost until we meet Elminster Aumar, another wizard of legend, close to 1300 years old, bringing a dire message:

> You must know that the Absolute is more dangerous than you can possibly conceive. It threatens all who live - even those who are undying. It threatens the gods, the Weave, the
very fabric of the universe itself. That is why I have come to charge you, Gale, with its destruction. It is Mystra's belief that only you can.

Gale is expected to voluntarily sacrifice himself, using the orb inside him as a bomb to destroy the Absolute. And for this Elminster puts a spell on Gale, by Mystras bidding, which
stops the orb from acting up. From this point on Gale doesn't have to consume magical artifacts, he just has to die. We don't know more and Gale doesn't need to know more. He
accepts his fate. If by his death, Mystra would forgive him, he would sacrifice himself gladly.

When we first meet this so-called absolute, we learn that it is an elder-brain, a mind-flayer hivemind, dominated by three mortals, using a Netherese artifact, The Crown of Karsus.
The very crown he used to try and ascend to godhood. The Crown that destroyed a whole civilization and threatened reality itself. If we prevent Gale from blowing himself up here,
he will start contemplating taking the Crown for himself. In his misguided bitterness he believes that mortals should really achieve power comparable to the gods. So that they
wouldn't have to be their playthings. Can we blame him? He was cast aside by his goddess when he made a mortal mistake, left to fend for himself until his demise seemed of
convenient usefulness. He is contemplating it, but never truly seems to believe that using the Crown would really be for the betterment of all.

This is when Gale is finally granted an audience with Mystra, who asks Gale why didn't he destroy the Absolute with the Crown when he had the chance.

> I didn't want to die. And when I saw the Crown, I thought I might not have to, if I only understood its power.

> And you believe you have the right to such an understanding? The past cannot be undone with self-pity, nor can a future be forged. Only with the truth will you see the
way ahead. The fragment of magic you tried to return to me was not of my creation. It was the Karsite Weave. It is a corrupted, half-born magic wrought in the brief moment
Karsus ascended to godhood. It hungers for power just as he did, and it can never be sated. You unleashed something that would consume all magic in existence, and yet you thought
only of preserving yourself.

> That can't be. It wasn't - it couldn't have been. I only wished to prove myself worthy. I had no idea...

> You were already worthy. What you lacked was patience, and it cost you dearly.

> The only reason the 'orb' sleeps is because I have allowed it to feed on the true Weave - a temporary measure, but one that will not be enough to save us. With each day that
passes, the elder brain threatens to become a new kind of god, its worshippers a scourge of soulless illithids. If you will not use the orb to end this abomination, then
you must find a way to separate Crown and host. When you've done this, you must surrender the Crown of Karsus to me.

> I won't let you down again. When the Absolute is vanquished, I will surrender Karsus' powers to you. You have my word.

> Thank you. May the Weave's light guide your purpose, and its wisdom guide your hand. The future of magic rests on your shoulders, Gale of Waterdeep. I promise you - it is a burden
you are strong enough to bear.

And so he is, and so he does.

It is interesting to see in the end that Mystra never really abandoned him. In fact she put the fate of all magic on the line so that Gale could live a little longer and get a
chance at saving creation. In the end, all that Gale ever needed was some faith. Some faith in himself that he was enough, and some faith in her goddess.

### Karlach

> Karlach is life itself.

She came from absolute poverty, then after she started to build a life for herself, her patron Gortash simply sold her to Zariel, the arch-devil of
the first layer of hell, Avernus. There they ripped out her heart and replaced it with an infernal engine, so she may fight endlessly in the eternal blood-wars.
She spent 10 years in hell, alone, without anyone to call a friend. Her isolation was complete and privation maximal.
Then she got infected by the tadpole and has managed to escape. Now, in the material world, she lives on borrowed time, because her engine can only exist in hell. It does not belong
in the material plane, so she is literally burning up from the inside. The magical flames emanating from her make it impossible for anyone to even touch her.
Finally, she got out of hell and still she can't touch anybody. She is desperate to have a hug, but she just can't have it. Later in the story we may fix her engine enough that
she can at least have some physical contact but not enough to ultimately save her. Can you imagine the amount of suffering she must have gone through? Then to learn that there is
nothing that can be done? Her only option at survival seems to be to return to hell. Which for obvious reasons she doesn't want to do.

Despite all of this she never gives up and the only thing she wants more than anything is to live. She never allowed herself to be corrupted by her circumstances.
To be twisted by resentment and grief. In a sense she is incorruptible. She will never join your character in any evil act, in fact she will leave you immediately if you indulge in
any, if not outright trying to kill you.

Understandably she is fueled by hatred against Gortash and seeks vengeance. However, when we finally manage to kill Gortash, Karlach realizes that her revenge was for nothing.
She will die regardless, her life remains stolen from her and there is nothing left for her. She says:

> But there's nothing, is there? I killed the bastard who ruined my life, and my prize is that I get to crawl into a corner and die. Am I fucking missing something?
He's dead, and he's no fucking sorrier now than he was before. What was the point? I'm still dying. I'm dying. I'm going to die!

Then she completely breaks down:

> My heart. It was mine, and they took it. I'm going to be as dead as a Gortash any day now. Any moment. And what then? Off to the City of Judgement to waste into oblivion? Into the
dirt to get eaten by maggots? Is that it for me?! Is that fucking all?! And you - you'll just keep going, won't you. Watching the stars. Warming your hands on the campfire. Dancing,
eating, making fucking love all night - all of it, all of it. That's my reward for everything I suffered. That's why I survived ten years of torment. The fighting, the clawing, the
loneliness, the fucking loneliness... All of it, so I could rot. Because the person I trusted the most gave me away to the devil. It isn't fair. I don't want it like this. I don't
want to die. I want to live. I want to stay.

Then again as likely countless times before it, she eventually refuses to give up. If later asked if she is alright, she will say:

> Yeah, despite my best efforts. I kept trying to flop over and give up, but Karlach just won't let me.

Then you say that there still might be hope for her:

> Maybe. But I think... I think the gods are trying to show me my fate. And I think I'm ready to look at it. Speaking of which. There's something I wanted to ask you. Will you stay
with me? When it's time. For me to go. I think I can do anything if you're there. Even die.

After you obviously confirm this, because you aren't a monster she says:

> Now! Enough tragedy! I'm not gone yet. And our schedule is packed with important heroics, isn't it.

That is goddam strength right there! And wisdom too. To face the certainty of your oblivion yet despite your suffering, despite your absolute torment, choosing to go forward, do the
right thing until your final breadth. Every other character sees this too and even Lae'zel can only speak of her admiration towards Karlach. This is how I think we all should aspire
to become, at least in principle.

There are 3 endings for Karlach. She becomes a mind-flayer and lives, she dies, or she goes back to Avernus. From these three only the last two are interesting. The death one, because
it really drills home who she was:

> I never gave up. I did my best. I did my best. It's the one thing I can't beat, isn't it? I wanted to live. In my city. With my friends. But life is for the living.
And I saw - gods (cry of pain)! Goodbye, sun. Goodbye, sea. Goodbye.

In my mind, however there is only one ending for her. When you convince her, with Wyll, the benevolent burden, to go back to Avernus together and face whatever may come.

> Better let these fuckers know I'm back. And this time, I'm not alone.

### Astarion

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX0EYVpGztg



When we reach Cazador's dungeon there, we find many horrors. One of which is the skeletal head of Cazador's old master, Vellioth. The fragment of a mind left within the skull
shares something horrific:

> Vellioth's recalls Cazador, his lessons learned, killing him in the Rite of Perfect Slaugher. How they both laughed! Veillioth recalls Cayador boiling the flesh from his skull
and then, to mock him, clamping his Schooling Scroll in Vellioth's jaws.

Here Astarion learns the true extent of suffering they have brought upon this world when he meets Sebastian, one of the first of his victims.

Sebastian tells Astarion that he was the first and last person he ever kissed, reminiscing about his last moments before his abduction. In shock Astarion asks:

> You should be dead. Why didn't Cazador feed on you?

> He made me a spawn. Left me her to rot. But I can't rot - I can't die. How long has it been? - Sebactian

> One hundred and seventy years. You were one of my first too. - Astarion

And thus Astarion learns the full truth. Previously he was only a murderer bringing food to his master. Now he is an accomplice in the centuries old suffering of thousands.

After finally killing Cazador, Astarion is faced with yet another brutal choice. Save seven thousand spawns, many of which he brought to his master, or kill them all.
Releasing them would unleash seven thousand souls many of which have been tormented for more than a century. The mind cannot comprehend their suffering and the subsequent
madness that they lived through. So he, only has one choice. Kill them all.

After this, Ulma, the leader of the Gur's forgives him and offers a few words of encouragement:

> For us, destroying evil is a simple choice. We are born to do it - trained to do it. But to face your kin? To face everything you know and still make that choice.
There is nothing simple there.

> It is a tragedy so many had to die, but had they lived they would have caused a thousand more tragedies. You did not choose an easy path, but you chose the correct
one.

### Shadowheart

### Lae'zel of K'liir

> Vlaakith requires everything of her children. I can't count how many bruises I've inflicted, can't measure how much blood I've drawn in the Undying Queen's name. I know only
blood-red and death-black. My mind is silver and my body steel. I am what I must be, say what I must be, to survive every beast I face and every wound I bear.

The Githyanki people hate the mind flayer race with a vengeance. They have been their slaves for thousands of years. Then one day a special Githyanki called Gith was born. She had
the ability to disrupt the mind flayer hivemind communication network. With this power the Githyanki finally broke free, and they have single-handedly ended the
mind flayer empire that has subjugated the known universe. However, to ensure their victory and to give their race an edge for all the fights to come, mother Gith has made a pact
, with the archdevil Tiamat, the dragon queen, allowing the Githyanki to ride her red dragons into battle whenever the need arose. The details of the pact are not know, but
mother Gith was never heard from again. In her place Tiamat's envoy proclaimed the first Vlaakith, and their line has been ruling the Githyanki ever since. Matriarchs of the Githyanki people, their words are gospel.
Fullfiling a Vlaakith's demands is as if one served mother Gith herself.
Thousands of years have passed, yet the Githyanki could not step beyond their hatred. They have organized their society
around military proves. Only the strongest may and should survive. Weakness of any kind is unacceptable and is punishable by death. Killing a ghaik, a mindflayer in their tongue,
is a rite of passage into adulthood. They follow the 10'000 protocols with religious fervor, specifying how a Githyanki should behave and should believe.

The current Vlaakith is the 157th in line and is called Vlaakith the Undying or the Lich Queen. According to the Githyanki she has ascended mortality and claimed
undeath, and has reigned for a thousand years. And there is no greater honor for a Githyanki then to ascend and become part of the personal guard of a Vlaakith.

When we meet Lae'zel we have already been infected by a Mindflayer parasite and would turn into full fledged Mindflayers in a matter of days through a process called
ceromorphosis:

> It starts with a fever and memory loss. Then you start to hallucinate. Your hair falls out and you bleed from every orifice. Your bones will change form. Your jaw will
split to allow room for four great tentacles. All skin will turn to gore, and be shed to reveal new flesh underneath. Then you have ceased to exist, and a mind flayer is born.

Lae'zel is rude and callous as we would expect for being raised as she has:

> The pupils themselves culled the weak from their ranks. I myself felled four of my own classmates once K'liir had a hundred times circled Toril.

Yet, she is deathly afraid. She spent her entire life sacrificing everything for Vlakith, so one day she may ascend. To fail and even worse, turn into a mind flayer is beyond
terrible. She is in fact so afraid, that on the first sight of sickness she would offer to kill us all and then herself just so that we do not turn.
This is why she is hellbent on finding a Créche, a githyanki stronghold, and be rid of the parasite by a machine built just for this purpose called a zaith'isk.

One of the first things she says at camp is:

> A fine evening, don't you think? The moonlight shines warmly on us. The breeze caresses our faces. Hideous. All of it. Would that I were doing battle up there, among the Tears.

Lae'zel is an incredible character. Despite all the top level rudeness and callousness, she is kind and caring, and even stronger than it initially seems. We can learn most about
this while romancing her. A matter in which she expresses her interest with blatant directness.

> I have a confession. I was too hasty to judge you. I thought you witless, gutless, unimpressively bland. Now, well - you've earned my respect, and more still. You've proven your
wits. You are efficient and dominant, in and out of battle. You've proven your courage. I swear, you would tear the horns off one dragon to plunge into another. And you're hardly
bland. Your scent alone is enough to make my neck sweat and my hairs stand on end. I want to taste you. Perhaps tonight. Perhaps later. But I want it all the same.

If we indulge in her proposition, we will initially see that she only wants sex and nothing more. Even the concept of cuddling is completely foreign to her:

> Chk. Overheated grappling, that wastefully eats into time better spent resting our muscles.

Lae'zel is ruthless in battle, but does not cling to resentment or seeks needless retribution. We can observe this when her argument with Shadowheart eventually escalates
into a duel to the death. Since Shadowheart has no real chance against Lae'zel, she tries to murder her in her sleep. If we manage to diffuse the situation, Lae'zel will comment on
the event as if this were the natural order of the world:

> It is over, where I am concerned. It is through conflict that we strengthen our bonds.

Eventually we find a githyanki patrol and observe how they have ruthlessly murdered a bunch of people in search of a weapon. Lae'zel unfazed approaches then to inquire about
the nearest créche. The leader of the patrol, Kith'rak Voss, Knight Supreme. The queen's silver, the queen's sword berates her immediately, basically telling her she should be
grateful she is still alive (just for talking to him, without permission) then describes that they are looking
for a weapon polyhedric in shape, that is likely with the ones who survived the nautoloid crash. In short, they are looking for us and Shadowheart's artifact. You would think
Lae'zel would immediately tell such a high ranking githyanki that we have the weapon they seek, dooming us to death. Yet she doesn't, she knows of the possible consequences, and she
will not betray us.

Eventually we reach the githyanki créche. If we choose to go there that is, which given what we have seen seems like suicide, but we want to be rid of the parasite and have no
other options left. In the créche we find this so called zaith'isk. Either we or Lae'zel sits in the chair. The purification begins, but throughout it, we quickly understand that the
device isn't meant to extract the parasite, rather the memories of the host, then erasing their mind altogether. There is no purification, only purging. The process eventually
ends in the destruction of the device and the first shock to Lae'zels world:

> What madness is this? The zaith'isk nearly destroyed me! I AM GITHYANKI. I WILL NOT BE GHAIK!

But she does not want to accept that purification was a lie:

> I followed protocol. I kept to my faith. Yet the zaith'isk might have killed me. The ghustil tampered with it. Traitor - and there may be more still! This must be why the
Inquisitor's come.

Then, if we seek out this inquisitor, he will demand that we hand over the artifact. Lae'zel initially wants to comply, but if we remind her of the zaith'isk, she will choose
to stand by us knowing full well, this may be our final moments. Then we may speak with an apparition of Vlaakith, who is not a little bit bothered by us slaughtering her
inquisitor. Here we learn that the artifact is The Astral Prism, an ancient gith artifact from the times when they have defeated the Illithid Empire. Vlaakith claims there is
a presence in the prism, an agent of the Grand Design whom we must kill it, in exchange she will cleanse and ascend Lae'zel. We enter the prism and meet the Dream Visitor. The entity
who has been protecting us from the Absolute all this time. Upon talking to the Dream Visitor we will learn that Vlaakith wants it dead:

> Vlaakith is lying to her people. She pretends to know how Gith destroyed the mind flayer empire. In truth, she knows nothing. If the Illithid Empire were ever to return, she
would be incapable of stopping them. And if her people found out about her impotence, there would be mutiny, revolution, the end of her rule. But that very power - the power to
resist illithid control - which Vlaakith only pretends to know, is how I've been protecting you.

Well, Lae'zel is not pleased with the results and demands to enter our memories, so she can see for herself.

> Vlaakith tacki na'zin. I see only - only madness. Vlaakith bears the full might of Tu'narath's arms, and the covenant of the great Mother Gith! Tsk'va! We are leaving this place
- now.

She sees the twinkle of truth despite her indoctrination. Even though, understandably the revelations shook her:

> I followed your path. What good, this heart of stone, for it to be shattered? She tests me. A trial of faith - K'liir prepared me. 'Only the heaviest souls soar to the Astral.'

She isn't ready to let go. Kith'rak Voss comes to us and begs Lae'zel to allow him to aid her. He knows we carry the Astral Prism, and he knows the entity inside is protecting
us. He isn't ready to tell us what this entity is, but if it chose us, Kith'rak will aid us whatever must be done.

> The Prism's tenant alone has the power to end Vlaakith's tyranny. I've sought their freedom for aeons.

Then we also get confirmation on what we have already seen:

> Lies, Lae'zel - every last one. There is no purification, no ascension. The zaith'isk does not purify - it extracts memory and kills the infected. Nor does the lich queen glorify the ascended. She feeds on most all of them to grow her power and pursue godhood.

Finally, Lae'zel starts to understand:

> 'Vlaakith'ka sivim hrath krash'ht. Only in Vlaakith may we find light.' These were the first words I ever read on tir'su slate. But they are no mere aphorism. They are law, they
are creed - the root from which the ten-thousand protocols stem. 'Forsake one protocol, and forsake Vlaakith. Forsake Vlaakith, and be the blood and meat which sates her dragons.'
If Voss speaks true - if ascension is a lie, if tadpole purification is a fairy tale, then I have not sinned against Vlaakith... She has sinned against me.

Her whole world is crumbling down. Everything she ever knew seems to be a lie, but she does not despair. She will find out the truth one way or another.

By this point Lae'zel seems to be falling in love with our avatar, and tries to resolve these feelings by the only possible solution she understands, combat:

> I am obsessed by the ground under your feet and the wind over your head. I see your face just before sleep and after I wake. I ask myself: are you worthy? Zhak vo'n'ash duj. There
is only one way for you to prove it. We fight. I test you in battle. Dance with me. Bleed with me. Bruise me so that you might possess me.

Then she stops the fight:

> No more. I can't bear it. I've torn flesh from monsters and men. I've laughed as they suffered. But you - I don't want to hurt you - I want to protect you. For you to protect me.
Zhak vo'n'ash duj. Source of my bruises.

Then at some point the Dream Visitor will call for our aid and summon us into the Prism again. There we learn two things. First, the Dream Visitor is a mind flayer called The
Emperor and second he isn't the only one in there. The other entity inside the prism is whom Vlaakith is really after, the one and only son of mother Gith, Orpheus the Prince
of the Comet. He has the power to disturb the mind flayer hivemind, and he is the one The Emperor is using to protect us all. Orpheus is bound by infernal chains, we couldn't free
him even if we wanted to, worse his hatred for illithids would force him to kill us all.

Now Lae'zel knows the truth:

> Every word Voss spoke, he spoke true. Orpheus is the living proof of the queen's lies, and the living weapon that conquered our ghaik slavers. One word from his lips, and
the people would doubt. Two words, and they would rage. Three words, and they would bow to the True Heir. If the githyanki are to be free, the Prince of the Comet must lead the
way.

It is time we met with Voss again. We meet him pleading to the devil Raphael. Begging to give him the Orphic Hammer, the only tool that can break infernal chains, the only tool
that could free Orpheus. What does the devil want in return? The Crown of Karsus would be sufficient. Why? He is not even subtle about it, to dominate and unite all the hells
under his command. He promises under his rule the hells would not leak out into the living, but after all we have seen, who would ever trust a devil?



Before the final battles against the elder brain would commence, Lae'zel will wake us again, at dawn, with something that we must see.

> Watch. I used to hate that sight. The glowing sky, the long shadows, the fading stars. I lived for the red of blood and the black of death. Now I see the colours between.
Look at the sun. What do you see?

> Hope. Life. A future worth fighting for.

> Yes. And something else too. Beauty. The dawn was my torment. Rustling leaves, agony. I couldn't wait to escape this place. Now, I revel in it. I revel in you. You showed me
the between and beyonds. Between war and peace, beyond passion and obsession. Most importantly - you showed me freedom. When all this is over, will you stay with me? For good?

Lae'zel has come full circle. She understood that life was about more than just combat and service, she understood that love is not weakness but strength, and most importantly, she
understood that she doesn't have to be alone. That she shouldn't be.

One way or another we get the hammer and with it, we can free Orpheus, at which point The Emperor forsakes us. Orpheus isn't too happy about how things stand. The Netherbrain is 
beyond our capabilities
and someone has to become an illithid.

After defeating the Netherbrain there are a number of endings for Lae'zel. She leaves alone or with Orpheus to liberate her people, or stays with you. In my mind either you
or Orpheus had to become a mind flayer so is best for Lae'zel to go and liberate her people. Before she says a few final words for you:

> Zhak von'n'fynh duj - source of my joy. Without you, I wouldn't have known warmth - only ice and fire. I can never forget you. Your name will be etched in our slates. You will
be called Mla'ghir -liberator.

### The Dark Urge

> As it was, so it is again. A hero has risen from a legacy of death.

## Notable non companion characters

### Jaheira & Minsk

### The Moonmaiden & Dame Aylin

, and this will culminate in a scene
with Lorroakan. A wizzard, much like Gale of great talent, but unlike him, one that only serves himself. Lorroakan aims to bind Dayme Aylin back into servitude, so he could
siphon her life force and extend his life to eternity. So he could play a god.

### Raphael & Hope

> My, my what manner of place is this? A path to redemption, or a road to damnation? Hard to say, for your journey is just beginning.

Are the first things Raphael says when we first meet him. Just by his mannerisms one can tell he is up to no good. Then we get transported into his home, which
he has named:

> The House of Hope. Where the tired come to rest, and the famished come to feed - lavishly.

Pretty aptly named house for one whose business model rests on exploiting other's hope, a devil. A fact that he is all to keen to reveal:

> What's better than a devil you don't know? A devil you do. Am I a friend? Potentially. An adversary? Conceivably. But a savior? That's for certain.

He says he wants to help us, but why would he?

> Because my compassion is boundless. I stride among the needy, giving comfort where I can. And you're in dire need. One skull, two tenants, and no solution in sight. I could
fix it all (snaps fingers) like that.

Of course no sane person can trust a devil, so when we reject his initial offering, he gets a bit frustrated:

> Try to cure yourself. Shop around - beg, borrow, and steal. Exhaust every possibility until none are left. And when hope has been whittled down to the very marrow of despair -
that's when you'll come knocking on my door. Hope. Hahaha! Such a tease.

Unsurprisingly not soon after we learn that the devil was lying all along. He can't cure us at all, and he knows it too. Our tadpoles are enhanced with Nethereese magic, not even
a god could cure us. But a devil doesn't care, he makes the bargain, and it is up to us to accept or deny it.

Throughout the game we will see him make offers and even see the results of some. It is particularly hard to see him put his claws into a little tiefling girl refugee, Mol, the
survivor of Elturel, bruised and battered, already missing an eye. She is holding together a band of kids, and they survive by stealing what they can. Not the best, and she knows it,
however there is nothing better. We don't ever learn what he offered her, but we fear she will take it. What we know for sure is that Raphael definitely has no good intentions for
her either:

> What a lovely specimen she is. A blushing apple, begging to be plucked. But don't you worry about Mol - it goes without saying she still has the unconditional freedom to choose
the only option she has left.

When we meet him at the Mausoleum in the Shadow Cursed Lands he warns us of a creature:

> There is a creature that lurks in silence and shadow - a creature who, like me, is very much of the infernal persuasion. Should it make its way out through the very doors
you are about to brazenly swing open, you'll have unleashed a pestilence upon this realm. In truth, it is carnage incarnate. So if you meet the devil of which I speak, kill it.
Consider no other course of action. Do not underestimate this opponent. At best you will have the blink of an eye to strike. Strike first. Strike true. Defy the odds, for they are
distinctly in its favour. That much I owe the bastard to concede. After all, if there is one rule I hold dear, it's that one must always give the devil his due.

Well, he does speak some truth, but as it seems to be the pattern, not near half of it. The creature inside is Yurgir, an Orthon, one of the generals of hell's armies. And would
you be surprised to learn that he was contracted by Raphael himself about a hundred years ago after the Sharrans unleashed the shadow on the land? His contract was to kill everyone
in the Grand Mausoleum:

> Spill all the blood sworn to the night. Silence all prayers; smother each rite. Wander Shar's halls; hungry to slay; Leave no Justiciar alive to obey. Leave none to hear it, then
be set free; This song is your oath, swear, swear to me.

Everybody in the Mausoleum has been butchered, yet Yurgir remains. Why is that? Raphael tricked him. According to the contract he cannot leave until everyone is dead within the
halls or by hell's rules he would become Raphael's slave. If we look around hard enough we can find a number of rats and if we happen to kill enough of them, they will start
attacking us.
Hundreds upon hundreds of rats. After a while they combine and the final remaining Justiciar in the Mausoleum takes shape. Then to no-one's surprise we can learn that Raphael gave
the spell to this last Justiciar, when he witnessed all his brethren being butchered by Yurgir. Allowing him to choose the only option he had left, and splitting his mind and body
into many.

When Raphael finally reveals to us that he wants the Crown of Karsus for the Orphic hammer, we can be pretty sure that whatever may be in the contract, should we take it,
Raphael would eventually win. As Wyll has warned us, the devil will only require what we are least ready to part with and then more still. We cannot take his deal, we have seen now
thrice how malicious he is, if we ever needed any convincing of this.

Thankfully we don't have to make a deal with the devil. We can just steal the hammer from his House of Hope, just as the Crown was stolen from Mephistopheles. Easier said than done.
Penetrating the hells, breaking into a devils home, stealing his most valuable asset. So naturally, as the true heroes we are, that is what we do.

At the beginning of our arguably most perilous quest in the game we meet a character right after entering The House of Hope. A woman half mad, swinging wildly between
coherence and madness. When asked who she is she says:

> Who am I? It's my favourite question. I scream it into the dark while I sleep, and whisper it to my memories when I wake. I'm the thing that kills you, and the only reason
you're alive. Made by a promise, undone by the truth. A handshake, a hug, the first beat of a newborn's heart. I am Hope. What little is left of her. A GUTTERING CANDLE IN A
UNIVERSE OF NIGHT. I'm not much a friend to anyone anymore. But I could use a friend myself. Do you want a friend to guide you through this madhouse?

She is a bit unhinged, not surprising, as we later learn Raphael has captured her long long ago and kept torturing her ever since. Breaking Hope would be the most satisfying thing
to him, but he just couldn't manage it so far. In her rambling Hope says:

> But I like you. I know I do, I think I do, I hope I do. I just need to ask one question, and I'll know for sure. Can you save me? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.

When we unquestionably agree she shares the plan:

> All right. You have to listen very very very closely. I will say this only once. Find the KEY. Take the hammer. Smash my chains. Find the key. Take the HAMMER. Smash my chains. Find the key. Take the hammer. Smash my CHAINS.

After reclaiming the hammer and smashing her chains, when we are about to leave Raphael appears, and he isn't very happy.

> There are many things in your world that I loathe. Litters of kittens, chattering children - the noise and the chaos of it all. In my world - in my HOUSE - there is order, and there
are rules. You have broken the most important rule of all, and committed the cardinal sin. You have brought the chaos of your world into mine. I will not abide it.

Then he addresses Hope as well:

> Oh, Hope, you are such a piteous thing. All it takes is a crumb from the table, and you forget the centuries of starvation. This insolence has earned you centuries more.

And then again to us:

> It's the fatal flaw of mortalkind. Take away their free will, and they call you a tyrant. Allow them to indulge it, and they become tyrants. You would have been heroes if you'd
only dealt fairly with me. Instead, you're not so different to doomed Karsus, over-reaching your limits, and burning your world to ash.

But Hope interjects:

> WRONG WRONG WRONG. They will save their world and smash you to smithereens.

One of the hardest battles in the game ensues, but with Hope on our side, we win, and can witness something special, after we tell Hope to come with us:

> And go where? I don't think I quite know how to be anywhere else but here anymore. With a lick of paint and a thorough cleaning, this could be a lovely little house. And I
can hardly leave - after all, who would ever want to think of Hell without Hope?
