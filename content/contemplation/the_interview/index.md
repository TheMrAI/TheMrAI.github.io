```text
- Huh, whe ... where am I?
- At the end.
- End ... and who are you? Did I just die!?
- You did.
Fear, anger and confusion all hit you at once, but just as fast they came they have passed. Like a memory from a the long past.
Here emotions, fade, memories fade, everything fades...
- Why am I here?
- To take account.
- Of what? My life?
- Indeed.
- Why? Are you going to judge me, then send me of to Heaven or Hell?
- I do not judge. You are the judge.
- I am the judge? You mean I am the one who decides my fate?
- Yes.
- Then what are you here for?
- So that you can only do so honestly.
- What is the point of honesty or judging? Am I dead or not?
- You judge, so you can correct, you do so honestly, so you can correct properly.
- Alright, I am dead, what can be the outcome of my judgement? Do I get to reborn?
- You will not be reborn.
- So I am already damned?
- No, there is simply no rebirth.
- No rebirth? What about afterlife then?
- No afterlife.
- What is there then?
- There is nothing. This is the end and there is nothing after.
- No. No! You are saying that there is nothing?! Something has to be there!
- There isn't.
- Then what is the point of this conversation?! What is the point of this judgement? What is the point of correction?
- There isn't any. Not to me, at least. For you though...
- What meaning can there be right before the end? You said I will just blink out of existence after this and there is nothing.
No retries, no hopes, no dreams. All gone! I will be gone. What meaning could such a moment have?
- What was your meaning when you were born?
- I, I don't know. How could I know? I was just born!
- But was there any meaning in it non the less?
- Maybe for my parents? They must have been excited to have me, I sure was with my kids. But what does this have to do with the now?
- Nothing and everything. It is completely different and exactly the same.
- Could you be less cryptic and just tell me?
- When you were born, you gave hopes and dreams to people around you. When you died all of those hopes and dreams died with you. But
others were born too.
- What do you mean? Now that I am dead others will find some new goals, without me?
- Yes.
- And that is it? I was, I lived, then died and things just go on.
- Exactly.
- This makes no sense at all! I am dead, what is the point of this stupid questioning? What does anything matter now?
- To me nothing.
- Then to whom? To me or to those left behind? If am dead, it doesn't matter to me. I can't change anything or affect anything now,
only hope that things will work out somehow. That my loved ones will be fine, that my children can grow up to be just as stupid as
I was.
- Is this any different from when you were alive?
- Of course! I mean ... err, but I was alive, I could make decisions!
- Really now, could you? Did you have any say in how your wife died?
- No, of course not, there are things I can't control!
- What is that you can control?
- I could control what I eat, drink, what I did with my life.
- What if you have been born somewhere else where these things didn't exists? Into a time where you would have been a slave or wiped out
by a plaque. You think you had those choices, but whether or not you could even comprehend them as choices wasn't in your control. You
did not know whether or not you would live to see the next day. You had no idea if a calamity was just around the corner to smite you down.
There was nothing, as such as you have described, that you controlled. You were merely granted the illusion of choice.
- Then what did I control?
-
