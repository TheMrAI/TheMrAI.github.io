sessions, how these can be mitigated and in general what should we watch out for while
doing so. To prepare the reader for what may come, many ideas/opinions might

If nothing else, approach this as an opportunity for a discussion, rather than
a threat to your internal balance.</p><p>My goal is to try and demonstrate why simple feedback sessions are
insufficient, why real results are much harder to obtain and require much more
sacrifice both on the individuals and the groups level. Whenever possible I will
aim to juxtapose the points made by regular daily activities that many if not
all have already encountered in their lives, so a more tangible example can be
obtained.</p><p>I am no expert by any means. Haven&rsquo;t received professional training, nor am I
planning too. Everything outlined here comes from either reading on the topics or
watching freely available lectures online.</p><p>The structure is as follows. In <strong>The baseline</strong> we will highlight how and perhaps why
our perceptions about the world are twisted, then in <strong>You are not alone, but it is up to you</strong>
the basic requirements for change are outlined. In <strong>A harmful way of feedbacks</strong> an
example of an insufficient feedback process is given, then finally in <strong>What could be done</strong>
a general guidance is outlined on how to give feedback a more productively.</p><h2 id=the-baseline>The baseline</h2><p>Life is incredibly difficult. We don&rsquo;t like to think about it, nor do we like to
show it. In fact whenever possible, we would do whatever we can to hide the truth
and only show what we deem best. That is why social media is full of
meticulously curated photos, videos, posts demonstrating lives unattainable. This
is why most people have no idea what is real and what is not. On the one hand
they are experiencing things as they are, but are shown that things are
otherwise. The overwhelming majority will then either deny what is in favor what
they want or simply ignore the problem on such a fundamental level, that they can
no longer consciously evaluate them.
According to the WHO&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression>Depression</a> page, Depression has become
the leading cause of disability worldwide affecting 5% of the population and
about <a href=https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/mental-health>10%</a> of the global disease burden originates from mental, neurological
or substance disorders. About 39% (!) of adults were classified as overweight in <a href=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight>2016</a>.
Obesity alone affects nearly half of the global population and we haven&rsquo;t even
touched on poverty yet.</p><p>Faced with such disparity between what is and what is demonstrated by our peers,
causes an internal struggle. Which is most easily &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; by ignoring it and
not thinking about it. This is fine, and even necessary. No-one can or should
even attempt to face all the difficulties of life. But since this
is the only thing we see as a solution, this is what we apply to our own lives to
our very detriment.</p><p>People simply tend to avoid what they don&rsquo;t understand. We have all experienced
situations where our gut feeling was telling us &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, it will be bad for
you&rdquo;, yet we ignored it and did it anyway. Then it turned out our little voice
was right, and we vowed to start listening to it, yet we kept making the same
mistake ever since. After a few such cycles we might even decide the endeavor is
hopeless and in some twisted way, perhaps we even deserve the suffering. In a
fell swoop our suffering is normalized, issues weren&rsquo;t solved and our pain never
ends.</p><p>It is not just you who is suffering, but everybody else is. You aren&rsquo;t an isolated
island doomed to face these difficulties alone. You are a node in the network of
people all within the same boat. Connect to them and start working together.</p><h2 id=you-are-not-alone-but-it-is-up-to-you>You are not alone, but it is up to you</h2><p>As described above, if possible, you would tend to ignore issues. So much so,
that you won&rsquo;t even notice opportunities for growth or correction. This is where
open discussion comes in. Where honest observations with trusted associates can
help us unravel the truth. Giving us the opportunity to make a change and to
strive for something better.</p><p>4 things are absolutely necessary for any kind of change. A desire on our side
for change, individuals whom we can trust and communicate our problems openly
with, these individuals&rsquo; willingness to help us find our own solution instead of
providing theirs and finally, the humility to try and fail as many times it is
necessary.</p><p>All four have to come together at once, and even then change will be hard.</p><p>Firstly, if you haven&rsquo;t arrived at the point where you, yourself have identified
that you should change something and then subsequently have decided to actually
do it, you won&rsquo;t. All the feedback, punishment or judgement in the world won&rsquo;t
sway you to act. For example, you have gained a little weight. In some recesses of
your mind you knew you wanted to lose it, but haven&rsquo;t really decided to do so
yet. Some people, as they often do, pestered you about it, made little jokes
about it, and even if you have agreed with them on a fundamental level, these
reminders never really helped. You just felt more hurt and ashamed and had to
spend so much of your energy just to recover your mood that you had none left
for the weight loss to even start.</p><p>Secondly and thirdly, change is extremely difficult, and it is necessary to have
someone to whom we can share this with. What is difficult, why do we think it
is, what we think might help. Then they listen and respond in the most honest
way they can. Without
passing judgement on your failings, they share their own perhaps, what they have
tried, what has worked, what hasn&rsquo;t. Both of you get a reminder that yes, change
is hard, yes failure is almost a guarantee, but that is fine. This is how it is,
and even if it only happens very slowly, it does. Each party is corrected a bit,
re-centered, so to speak on their path. Each a bit rejuvenated, can face their
foes again.
What has been described in the psychological literature is defined as the
therapeutic relationship.
For example if you had a good partner or a friend with whom you could share
anything with, chances are you have experienced such a relationship. You looked
forward to being with them, regardless what mood you were in, or what tasks you
had to do.
This is also the prerequisite of going to a therapist. If this is missing, hell
can freeze over and nothing would change for the better.</p><p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly, one has to have the humility to understand
and accept (!) that they will fail. Many, many, many times. Not just they,
anybody else they would like to see improve. It is inevitable and it is alright.
Change is difficult not just because the thing we are trying to do is hard, but
because the behavior is connected to our habits, to our personality, to how our
lives have been lead. Understanding these aspects is critical to even formulating
an attainable goal.
For example, and for the sake of brevity, let&rsquo;s examine the personality trait
agreeableness (one of the Big Five). For simplicity let&rsquo;s say someone scores
really high on this trait, making them very agreeable. These people will tend to
prioritize others over themselves. They will tend to agree. Might have
their own opinions, but disregard them quickly in favor of someone else&rsquo;s. They
would take on willingly more work than they can manage, or can be so easily pressured
into doing so that their exploitation stays overlooked by everyone. They won&rsquo;t be able to
deliver, won&rsquo;t complain about the overload and won&rsquo;t ask for help. Likewise, they would
rather burn themselves to the ground, than to disappoint others (perceived
or otherwise).
In the very extreme, their aptitude for pleasing can be so pervasive that
they can&rsquo;t formulate what they want/desire, because that was secondary for so
long it no longer registers.
Knowing about this is extremely important, because personality traits are
considered to be stable and immutable. Someone in this predicament cannot
solve this. They can learn to mitigate it, but it can take years of cognitive
behavioral therapy to do so, and even then, when overwhelmed they can easily
revert to previous states.
There are simply things that people need to learn to live with.</p><p>For clarity, I would like to also formulate the sub-textual message that is so
often overlooked in all representations of struggle and subsequent change in the
media. The journey is not glamorous and even less so heroic. In fact when you are doing it
your suffering only intensifies, until you finally reach the next plateau and can
realize some improvement. Even worse, the change comes by actively doing
something different to how you would want to in the situations which are the
hardest to you. When this comes and when you win or loose, you have to never
forget this is ultimately about you, and for you. You have to take care of
properly awarding yourself if you win, and not abolishing yourself if you loose.</p><h2 id=a-harmful-way-of-feedbacks>A harmful way of feedbacks</h2><p>All this prelude was done in the hopes of demonstrating that there is more under
the hood than what we would like to accept. That we deliberately try to avoid
issues as part of our nature.
But since we all feel that something isn&rsquo;t right when it
isn&rsquo;t we try to do something and easy to comprehend/implement &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; that we
decide are good enough are what we will tend to go for.</p><p>These actions are easy to implement, but in essence help little. We are doing something
we want to believe works, yet we read about colleagues having mental breakdowns
or more commonly simply not knowing anything about their problems at all.</p><p>In a typical corporate environment feedback sessions can occur on a quarterly/annual basis
or perhaps never. For this example let&rsquo;s take a look at a quarterly group feedback session.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say the following instructions are given for the feedback session:</p><ul><li><p>prepare at least one positive and one negative feedback about your teammates</p></li><li><p>focus on them being helpful and actionable, but it is okay to point out
something minor</p></li><li><p>don&rsquo;t fight or question the feedback, as you can take it or leave it</p></li></ul><p>The feedback sessions occur every 3-4 months. You are in an environment where you
are prepared to get feedback, but not necessarily in the mindset to receive it.
This is an event that everyone attends ultimately because it is
mandatory, not because they seek guidance or advice at that time.
That is okay however, as you can opt to not do anything with the feedback. At
this point our first requirement for change can easily go out the window. Even if
change was somehow required, most of the time people would still ignore the
feedback. By ignoring in this sense it is the same to not act on it or forgetting
it by the next day.</p><p>The second requirement is likely not met either. It is not likely that we trust
each teammate, and even less likely that we can be vulnerable in such an
environment. We each share what we are willing to vocalize, likely knowing that
we have ignored things that were important.</p><p>The third criterion is not met outright, given the setup. As we don&rsquo;t know what
the individual has done or why, because we haven&rsquo;t bothered to ask or understand
what has happened. If we give any actionable step, that is only based on our view
of the world, not theirs. Which is an ultimately lopsided situation. We cannot
know what is good for them. Only they can know what to do, and they have to
figure it out too.
In these instances feedback simply doesn&rsquo;t make sense to the receiver. They
are told something they feel is not true, doesn&rsquo;t ring right, yet there is
nothing they can do.
The step by which trust can be forged has been skipped, and the quickest action
was implemented.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tell them what is wrong with them, how they can solve it, and
who cares what is the truth or the circumstances. My job is done here.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Even worse when there is no adequate example, which is likely not going to work
either as memory is a fickle thing, and it is hard to remember events that have
happened somewhere during a 3-4 month time span.</p><p>Finally, the fourth requirement is trivialized away. No meaningful change occurs
in 3-4 months. Especially if people aren&rsquo;t actively working on changing, on their
own volition. As if there was an expectation that something could happen, by
applying such cheap intervention. This sends a message however subtle it may be
that if you fail to change in this period you are failing. Then you get
reminded that you did. Will that motivate you to do better next time?</p><h2 id=what-could-be-done>What could be done</h2><p>Don&rsquo;t concern yourself with others problems. It is their burden and it is theirs
alone. It is not your place to tell anybody what to do and if you look deeply
into yourself you should already know that. Furthermore, it is up to you to make the choice to
change, it is up to you to decide to seek help, and it is up to you to cherish the
moments when you manage to squeeze in a win.
It is arrogance that makes people believe they can help others, that they know
better. They don&rsquo;t. Our lives with their ups and downs are our responsibility and
the moment we can accept that, aspects of it can start coming under our control.
We grow a little, the horizon of what we believed ourselves capable off grows a little, but we
had to do it. And only we could do it. Little by little we can learn that we can
do what we want, but only if we act as we know we should in the situations we are
least likely to do so. Those are the moments that matter. They occur each and
every day, and they are very small. So small it is hard to notice you are making
any progress. That is why you need others you trust, others you can share with,
who see you from a different perspective. That is when you get feedback, when
you inquire. It starts and ends with you.
In fact if the choice is taken away from you, you will only become weaker. You
will only shrink away from your responsibilities as they become in a sense
external. You have already learned (or should have learned) that not many
external things are under your control if any, so your options diminish.</p><p>It is so important to not help when it is not requested, that in retirement homes
there is a rule that may seem brutal but is vital for the wellbeing of the
residents. Nurses are told &ldquo;Do not do anything for the individual that they can,
however painfully, slowly or badly, do themselves.&rdquo;, because if you do, you may
feel better helping them, but what happens from their world is that more and
more things that they could do are taken away. Your help makes them weaker. One
more thing becomes lost to them.</p><p>Focus on yourself, because your burdens are enough for you, most often than not,
even too much. Make yourself better, by accepting the little things that bother
you and try to alleviate them. For example &ldquo;It bothers me when XYZ doesn&rsquo;t react
to my Slack, messages.&rdquo;. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they understand that my questions are important?&rdquo;.
Instead
of holding this in, because you think it is petty and is your own shortcoming you
can ask what has happened? You can try to understand their perspective and then
help them see yours. If you do so you make an actual connection. They see you as
an individual, and you see them better as well. A bit of trust is made,
because they have shown some of their weakness, but they wanted to understand
yours too.</p><p>This is what you should strive to do. Sometimes it won&rsquo;t work for you, sometimes
won&rsquo;t work for them and many times nothing good may come of it, but an argument.
You do it anyway when you feel you should. That is why you have the feeling, it
is telling you to do something. Obviously that doesn&rsquo;t mean you knee-jerk act out
of anger and curse someone. Manage the emotions but, don&rsquo;t ignore them. Then, when
you are ready, you face the challenge.</p><p>Better yet, if you manage to apply this for a certain span of time, you will
demonstrate that this is okay to do so, that this is a way. If you do it right,
it will become a good way, a desirable way, then you will start to receive honest
feedback yourself. Then you can handle it better. You no longer assume, but
connect, you no longer tell, but ask.
People want to share and want to help, especially when they see something good
comes of it.
But for any of this to happen everything has to start with you. You make the
choice, collect the strength and the humility to take on the quest.</p><p>If you do not, nothing will change, nothing can change.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://themrai.github.io/>&copy; MrAI 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
