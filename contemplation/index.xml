To prepare the reader for what may come, many ideas/opinions might strike the reader as painful, ridiculous or even rage inducing. When this occurs please try to understand the points before dismissing them entirely. You may not agree at all, but there is always something that can be gained from an argument.</description></item></channel></rss>
