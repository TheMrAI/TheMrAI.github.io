I don&rsquo;t use it
all the time, but I do sit at my table for work and for leisure and when I happen to
not listen to music I need space to work.</p><p>It would be nice if I could put the headphone to an easily accessible place, but not
on the workspace.</p><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>So what can be done? I should mount a hook to the table, but that would need a good mounting
method which isn&rsquo;t very easy to fabricate form plastic. I got a lamp already that is in the
optimal position, has excellent mounting, maybe it could be mounted onto that.</p><p>Finally, I have learned my lesson about 3D modelling and this time I didn&rsquo;t try to fabricate
everything in Fusion 360. Instead, made some sketches beforehand and set most of the
dimensions that I could. It seems to me that the model comes together fast if there are some
dimensions already set. Without those everything is very undefined.</p><figure><img src=headphone_holder.png><figcaption><h4>Headphone holder</h4></figcaption></figure><p>There is one idea that I would like to highlight. A small incident angle of 5 degrees was
added to the hook, so that the headphone itself would always try to slide into the hook,
rather than out of it. Yes, the design shows 10 degrees, but during modelling that seemed
excessive.</p><figure><img src=holder.png><figcaption><h4>Front plate</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Another change between the sketch and the design was the elongation of the flaps used to
connect the two pieces. Now they are of the same height as other parts of the piece.
Originally one screw was drawn for each side, but during designing
it seemed more appropriate (and aesthetically pleasing) to double the screws too.</p><h2 id=printing>Printing</h2><p>The printing went smoothly with the first part. The PETG filament was a bit wet, so it
sputtered a bit, that is why it turned out so milky. Not too happy about that, but I can&rsquo;t
dry yet the filament, and technically it doesn&rsquo;t affect the strength of the result.</p><figure><img src=front.jpg><figcaption><h4>Front plate</h4></figcaption></figure><p>The back part was a bit trickier. Printed it, so the layer lines would run along the length
of the hook arm. This maximizes strength for the part.</p><p>Finally, put a few M3 inserts into them. These aren&rsquo;t strictly necessary, but they look good
and allow us to disassemble the part if it ever came to that.</p><figure><img src=back_with_inserts.jpg><figcaption><h4>Back</h4></figcaption></figure><p>There was a small unexpected issue, however. It seems that printing the part on its side
somehow allowed the arch to warp a tiny bit. As it can be seen below, the front part had
no such deformation thus fits perfectly while the back part did.</p><figure><img src=fit.jpg><figcaption><h4>Fit</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, this is plastic, and for completely unrelated reasons four screws were designed
for it instead of two. That means we can torque it until it fits! Muhaha, if you aren&rsquo;t
smart enough there is always enough force!</p><p>Not gonna lie, I was bracing for something to break, but it seems the material gave just
enough. Maybe it became a bit stronger overall given all the internal tension? Well, I have
no idea, but it is done, the headphone fits, mission completed.</p><figure><img src=final.jpg><figcaption><h4>Final</h4></figcaption></figure><h2 id=files>Files</h2><p>Fusion 360 link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gabkOTwsyeXRfXbeHZjVoOgK3Ei3-Fd1/view?usp=sharing">heaphone_stand</a></p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://themrai.github.io/>&copy; MrAI 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
